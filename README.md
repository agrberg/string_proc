`String#to_proc`
==============

`string_proc` extends Ruby's `String` class with a `to_proc` method, allowing you to chain multiple method calls on each element of an enumerable using the `&` shorthand syntax.

```ruby
objects.map(&'method_1.method_2')

# is equivalent to the more verbose

objects.map { |element| element.method_1.method_2 }
```

### Example

Turning an array of symbols into capitalized strings:

```ruby
[:one, :two].map(&'to_s.capitalize')
  # => ["One", "Two"]
```

Errata
------

Similar to its counterpart, [`array_proc`](https://github.com/agrberg/array_proc), I recommend caution using this in production code. It's non-idiomatic Ruby and may cause more confusion than convenience. However, it can be a valuable tool for exploring and debugging objects in a REPL. For that reason, I often include it in my `Gemfile` with `require: false` ensuring that it won't be unintentionally used in code without explicitly requiring it via `require 'string_proc'`.

This is one of the first small gems I published, as it provides functionality that I find useful across multiple projects. By packaging it as a gem, I can avoid duplicating the code and reduce the need for repetitive testing in each project.

Installation
--------------------

Include it in your project's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'string_proc'
```
